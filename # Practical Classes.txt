Namespace - 1 question in exam

to change the global variable use the global queuer
glbal scope can be ACCESSED anywhere

Within the function if there is a variable named the same as the global scope,  python takes precedence local scope over global scope

why do we use function inside a function?

global scope - global to function(Important)

#not that important
non local - used to manipulate the variable inside the function(function inside function)
